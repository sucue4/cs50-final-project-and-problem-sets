# Explanation for Code and Folders in this Repository
This is the work I did for Harvard's CS50 and some of the submissions I made. 

In the `Problem Set 6` folder, it shows some basic code that I did in order to complete the requirements for the problem set of week 6 that was the intro to Python. I included the submissions that I felt more confident about and wasn't complicated. Here are the [requirements](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/psets/6/) from that week. It uses variables, if else functions, and for loops.

The `completion` folder shows a screenshot of my grade and completion of the Harvard CS50 course on their gradebook.

In the `project` folder, there is a README.md file that explains the different code and files that I used to make my NBA Draft website.

In the `songs` folder, there are different files that uses SQL in order to filter information and songs from the database. It follows the instructions from Week 7 and can be found [here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/psets/7/songs/).

Lastly, the `trivia` folder includes the code for the website submission I made for [week 8](the https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/psets/8/trivia/). This includes of HTML, CSS for styling, and some Java elements. The code was used to make NBA-based trivia questions with one being multiple choice and the other being free response. There are buttons to confirm the answers of the user and their choice will be highlighted in red for incorrect and green for correct. There are different functions such as `checkChampion` and `checkTeam` to check if the answers are correct. The different IDs check for the correct inputs and update the different parts of the website.
