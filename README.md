# Explanation for Code and Folders in this Repository
This is the work I did for Harvard's CS50 and some of the submissions I made. 

In the `Problem Set 6` folder, it shows some basic code that I did in order to complete the requirements for the problem set of week 6. I included the submissions that I felt more confident about and wasn't complicated. Here are the [requirements](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/psets/6/) from that week.

The `completion` folder shows a screenshot of my grade and completion of the Harvard CS50 course on their gradebook.

In the `project` folder, there is a README.md file that explains the different code and files that I used to make my NBA Draft website.

In the `songs` folder, there are different files that uses SQL in order to filter information and songs from the database. It follows the instructions from Week 7 and can be found [here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/psets/7/songs/).
